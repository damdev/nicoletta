Nicoletta: A silly minimal static blog generator
------------------------------------------------

Inspired by: [James Harding's post](http://www.jamesharding.ca/posts/simple-static-markdown-blog-in-flask/)

How does it work?
-----------------

1. Install he requirements: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
2. Run ``./nicoletta.py auto -b`` and you will see a web browser window showing you your site.  
3. Edit your templates in ``templates/``, your posts in ``posts/`` or your configuration in ``conf``
4. See the web browser refresh itself and be amazed
5. Deploy ``output/`` somewhere and be done.
