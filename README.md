Nicoletta: A silly minimal static blog generator
------------------------------------------------

Inspired by: [James Harding's post](http://www.jamesharding.ca/posts/simple-static-markdown-blog-in-flask/)

How does it work?
-----------------

1. Install he requirements: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
2. Add/edit/remove posts in the ``posts`` folder
3. Run ``./nicoletta.py auto -b``

You will see a web browser window showing you your site.

4. Edit your templates in ``templates/``, your posts in ``posts/`` and your config in ``conf``
5. See the web browser refresh itself and be amazed
6. Deploy ``output/`` somewhere and be done.
